# Assessment-of-Fruit-Quality-using-Hyperspectral-Imaging-with-the-help-of-Deep-learning

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is most efficient way of retaining information using Deep learning concept. It is very intricate task to identify the rotten fruits without destructing it, HSI is non-destructive way of collecting data of fruits, which ease the process of sorting with an help of Algorithm. Deep Learning employs neural network method to exploit the connection between the spatial context and spectral context. HSI stores the wavelength of refracted, reflected and absorbed light in several bands which also contain noise produced by machinery used that is filtered using SMV(Standard normal variate).Filtered information is represented by hyperspectral cube(3D). An image pre-training convolution neural network (CNN) is used on dataset and then tunned to provide classifier. In this model most dataset (80%) collected is used to train the neural network, while (20%) dataset for verifying the process. The obtained proves that this process of analysis using CNN algorithm is more accurate (>90%) and effective.
